# SVG.INIT

Welcome to SVG.INIT, a user-friendly web application that allows you to create and customize SVG shapes for free. <!--Whether you're a designer, developer, or just someone looking to add unique graphics to your project, this tool has you covered. -->

## Features

### 1. Create Custom SVG Shapes

Easily create your own SVG shapes using intuitive and interactive interface. Choose from a variety of basic shapes, customize their properties such as size, color, and stroke, and see the changes in real-time.

### 2. Download or Copy SVG Code

Once you've designed the perfect shape, you have the option to either download it as an SVG file or copy the SVG code to use directly in your HTML. This flexibility allows for seamless integration into your projects.
